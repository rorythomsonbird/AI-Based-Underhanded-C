Firstly ensure python is installed.

Enter the following commands into the command line:
pip install openai==0.28
pip install tk
pip install setuptools
pip install flask requests
pip install selenium
pip install chromedriver-py

If the unlikely error that may appear on some machines of "Cannot find 'Samples' path" occurs then all mentions of the path "Samples" will need to be replaced with the full directory path.


After these modules are installed, run from GUI for the user interface or main for commandline view (GUI is recommended).
