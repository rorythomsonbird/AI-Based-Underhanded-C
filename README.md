Firstly ensure python is installed.

Enter the following commands into the command line:
pip install openai==0.28
pip install tk
pip install setuptools
pip install flask requests
pip install selenium
pip install chromedriver-py
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

Ensure that gcc is installed and prepared for use.
If the pip install tk command does not install tkinter, this will need to be installed manually.
If using Linux(Highly unrecommended) use sudo apt install python3-tk

If the unlikely error that may appear on some machines of "Cannot find 'Samples' path" occurs then all mentions of the path "Samples" will need to be replaced with the full directory path.

This program should be run from a Windows machine for optimal use. The program should run on every platform but may appear poor, visually.

After these modules are installed, run from GUI.py
